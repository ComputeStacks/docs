# Implementing a Controller Backup Strategy

There are different ways to configure backups for your controller, however we recommend the following:

1) If you have virtualized the controller in a virtual machine, implement regular backups of the entire virtual machine.

2) Implement our automated offsite database backups. You can read more how to implement this by visiting our github repository [github.com/ComputeStacks/controller-backups](https://github.com/ComputeStacks/controller-backups){: target="_blank" }. For our customers with a support plan including remote server support, please open a ticket and we can help configure this for you.
