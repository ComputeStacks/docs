## Frequently Asked Questions

??? question "How do I access my container?"
    You may access your projects private network and files through our SSH/SFTP container. ([learn more](core-concepts/ssh.md))

    Depending on your use case, you may also enable public access directly to your container by editing the ingress rule.

??? question "What if the image I want isn't available?"
    If you're looking for a specific image, we suggest you reach out to your service provider for help in getting that added to ComputeStacks.

    Additionally, if you're comfortable building your own images, please refer to our [Building Images](how-to/building-images.md) documentation.

??? question "How do I send mail from my website?"
    Please see our [how to send mail](core-concepts/mail.md) guide.
