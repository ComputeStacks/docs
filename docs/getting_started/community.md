# Join our Community Chat

We offer two platforms for connecting with our team, and other community members. 

## Slack

As part of your license with us, we will create a private slack channel which we will use for collaborating on your platform and any issues that arise. 

* If your organization already has a paid slack account, please [contact us](mailto:hello@computestacks.com?subject=Slack%20Connect%20Request) so that we may use [Slack Connect](https://slack.com/connect){: target="_blank" } to create a shared channel. This will allow you to communicate us without having to create a separate slack user.

* If you currently have a free slack account, or are new to slack, please [contact us](mailto:hello@computestacks.com?subject=Slack%20Invitation%20Request) to request an invitation.

## Discord

We have created a public community on Discord that will allow anyone to come and discuss ComputeStacks. All are welcome, whether you are a user, provider, or just curious about our platform.
