# Join our Community Chat

We have two great ways to connect with other members of our community, including our team. Come to discuss with other ComputeStacks users and team members!

## Slack

Please visit our [slack signup page](https://slack.computestacks.com){: target="_blank" } to request an invite to our user group.

## Matrix

Matrix is a open, decentralized protocol for communicating. ComputeStacks maintains a public server that everyone is welcome to join.

### Private E2E Rooms

Once you have joined our community, please reach out to one of our team members and we will create a private, end-to-end encrypted, room for us to communicate.

If you would prefer _not_ to join our public community, simply reach out to one of our team members and we will invite you to a private room.

### New to Matrix?

If you're brand new to matrix, the easiest way to get started is by signing up and creating your account through the [element webapp](https://app.element.io/#/welcome){: target="_blank" }. They also offer downloaded apps for your mobile devices, and your desktop computers.

??? tip "Once you've logged in, be sure to setup your encryption key for E2E chat"

    Our general chat does not have E2E enabled in order to allow new members to view the previous discussion. However, for 1-to-1 chats, or when using our private rooms, we request that you enable E2E.
